   This file contains the definitions of the user - functions used to draw the fundamental graphics.

   The definitions and definitions are as follows :-

  - <b>void lineDDA(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int COLOR)</b>   
  
	    Draws a line of specified COLOR from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) using DDA line drawing algorithm.

  - <b>void lineBres(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int COLOR)</b>
  
	    Draws a line of specified COLOR from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) using Bresenham line drawing algorithm.

  - <b>void circleMid(int xc, int yc, int r, int COLOR)</b> 
    
	    Draws a circle of radius r centered at (xc, yc) using Midpoint algorithm.

  - <b>void circleBres(int xc, int yc, int r, int COLOR)</b>

	    Draws a circle of radius r centered at (xc, yc) using Bresenham algorithm.
